          As Bhagavan says “Every child is a flower in the Garden of Sai”, the
          BV Alumni of Odisha decided to cater the Garden of Sai – “Sai Vaatika”
          – in each Sai Schools of Odisha so that the Flowers of the Garden will
          become more beautiful with soothing fragrance. The Team Sai Vaatika at
          each Sai School with their participation as Mentors in Madhu
          Vadishyami is now caring the flowers in Sai’s Garden so as to fill the
          flowers with Sai’s Love.
