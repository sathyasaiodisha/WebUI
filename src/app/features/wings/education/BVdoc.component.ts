        <h4>Ananda Udyaan</h4>
        <p>
          In a letter to His elder brother Bhagavan wrote in 1947, “I have a
          task, to foster all mankind and ensure them lives full of Ananda.” So
          His Mission was to ensure a life full of Ananda for all. His call
          therefore was, “I am Ananda Swarupa. Come and take as much Ananda as
          you can from Me.” To fulfil His Divine Mission, Bhagavan granted
          mankind His greatest gift, Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation. Every
          activity of Sai Organisation aims at giving Ananda to the
          participants. Ananda Udyaan is one such activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ananda Udyaan is a unique initiative of the Balvikas Wing of Sri
          Sathya Sai Seva Organisations Odisha. It is a one-year Pre-Balvikas
          Program which serves as a Purposeful Nursery leading to Balvikas. It
          is a village-based program which was started in Odisha in November
          2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ananda Udyaan Centres are being run in villages where there is no
          Balvikas with an aim to start Balvikas there after one year of
          completion of Ananda Udyaan. In all these villages children from all
          age groups are participating in this program. A specific syllabus
          which is inspiring and enjoyable for village children is being
          implemented for this purpose. To give support to Ananda Udyaan Gurus,
          two state level training programs have already been conducted through
          which 195 gurus have undergone training and acquired required skill to
          run Ananda Udyaan Centres.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Ananda Udyaan is in full swing leading to the formation of 123 new
          Rural Balvikas Centres in November 2024 with thousands of Balvikas
          Children and hundreds of Balvikas Gurus. This will give momentum to
          the Gram Seva activities in many new villages.

        <h4>Madhu Vadishyami</h4>

        <p>
          To sow the seeds of faith in the tender hearts of tiny-tots, the
          Balvikash Wing of Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations Odisha prayed
          Bhagavan for implementation of Madhu Vadishyami, A Divine Project in
          all our Sai Schools so that the <u>“Seeds of Faith”</u> will grow into
          <u>“Plants of Love”</u>. Bhagavan blessed our state profusely as a
          result of which the Balvikash Wing of Odisha could implement Madhu
          Vadishyami in all Sai Schools. The project was launched on 3rd July
          2023, on the occasion of holy Guru Purnima Day in Sai Janani
          Bhubaneswar and schools started offering their saadhana with Faith and
          Love at the Lotus Feet involving children, teachers and parents into
          it. Madhu Vadishyami...became their language, the language of their
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Children, teachers and parents are writing Likhita Japa; schools are
          reverberating with Vedic Chants by children and teachers; Study
          Classes for children on Bhagavan’s Divine Life and Study Circles for
          teachers and parents on Bhagavan’s Divine Mission are being held;
          children and teachers are rendering their Loving Seva by cleaning
          school premises, distributing fruits in hospitals, helping in
          plantations, offering Jala-seva and maintaining discipline in Samithi
          activities; And everybody is deriving Divine Bliss from Bhajans.
        </p>
        <p>
          To put enthusiasm in children and parents and give momentum to the
          project, various participatory events are also being conducted under
          the banner of Madhu Vadishyami. Children are practicing CoD and
          organising CoD Exhibition. Parents are also with all enthusiasm taking
          part in Open Mic, Wishing Tree and Craft Workshops. The details of all
          these activities are being recorded in the Saadhana Darpana .
        </p>
        <h4>Sai Vaatika</h4>
        <p>
          As Bhagavan says “Every child is a flower in the Garden of Sai”, the
          BV Alumni of Odisha decided to cater the Garden of Sai – “Sai Vaatika”
          – in each Sai Schools of Odisha so that the Flowers of the Garden will
          become more beautiful with soothing fragrance. The Team Sai Vaatika at
          each Sai School with their participation as Mentors in Madhu
          Vadishyami is now caring the flowers in Sai’s Garden so as to fill the
          flowers with Sai’s Love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because they have proudly named them as “Messengers of Sai Love”, the
          BV Alumni of Odisha is offering their Loving Seva to spread Sai’s Love
          in all our Sai Schools since 24th April 2022 and with Swami’s Grace,
          it will go on and on….
        </p>
        <h4>Manmanaa Bhava</h4>
        <p>
          Baba has clearly defined the Role of BV Gurus in the Bal Vikash
          Movement:
        </p>
        <p>
          “Parents of some children are not readily coming forward to enrol
          their children in the BV classes. You should explain to such parents
          about the true importance of BV and make an attempt to join their
          children in BV group.” BV Gurus therefore need to take this message to
          thousands of parents and would-be parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the sagacity of Manmanaa Bhava, BV Gurus in our state are
          reaching out Thousands of Parents to get them convinced and motivated
          towards the Divine Program of BV. This out-reach is slowly but
          certainly fulfilling Bhagavan’s Idea of reaching-out the parents
          thereby to ensure Shatasahasra Sanjogikarana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Launched on 3rd July 2023 on the holy Guru Purnima day, Manmanaa Bhava
          is in full swing in Odisha with its Five Petal – Parents Contact
          Program, Parents Meet, Parents Involvement Program, Parents Study
          Circles and SSS Dynamic Parenting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expansion of and Involvement in BV is a continuous process. Where
          there is Involvement, there is Expansion. Manmanaa Bhava ensures
          involvement of BV Parents into the Divine Mission leading to
          expansion. Where there is Expansion, there is a Flow.Where there is a
          Flow, there is a Goal. And the Goal is to Restore Dharma.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Festivals Flavours</h4>
        <p>
          All stakeholders of BV experience a new flavour of Aradhana Mahotshava
          during 1st – 24th April every year. During this period celebrations
          are arranged in hundreds of BV Families. Aradhana Month is
          reverberated with Bhajan and Sathsang in every home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding to this flavour, the Eswaramma Week quickly comes to multiply
          the Divine Joy of BV Children. It touches every heart in a unique way.
          Every day in first week of May (1st – 7th) is a Day of Celebration by
          the children, of the children and for the children in their respective
          homes with their parents and other family members.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first day is the day of preparing the Home-Sweet-Home for
          celebration, the second day is for worshiping the parents in the
          feeling of Maatru Devo Bhabah, and the third day is the day of Plant
          Parenting which is celebrated with a promise to parent a plant by the
          child. The fourth day is meant for Blossoming of Excellences inherent
          in each child, the fifth day is for Swadhyaya Sadhana, the sixth day
          is dedicated to Mother Eswaramma, and the seventh day is for Happy
          Culmination of Eswaramma Week, nay, a beginning for a more purposeful
          life.
        </p>
        <h4>Sri Sathya Sai Centre for Human Excellence</h4>
        <p>
          Bhagavan says,
          <i
            >“....People feel that education helps in materialistic pursuits and
            rest content with this. This is not a right attitude. Education
            should promote culture. It is not by education alone but by culture
            that one gets refined.... What is education without culture? It is
            like a kite cut off from its main thread. It is not possible to
            predict where this kite would land....”</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the development of approaches to
          <b><i>“education-interweaved-with-culture”</i></b> needs to be placed
          in the global context but rooted in the national and local cultural
          needs. The research paradigms in this field needs to be evolved.
          Keeping this in mind and taking it forward and inward, a Research
          Institute with the name
          <b><i>“Sri Sathya Sai Centre for Human Excellence (SSSCHE)”</i></b>
          and with the moral <b><i>“Tasya Pragnya Pratisthitaa”</i></b> has been
          established in the premises of Sai Janani Bhubaneswar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SSSCHE aims at Creating an opportunity for the pursuit of research
          in the fields of Spirituality & Culture, Ensuring its visibility in
          the society by empowering itself to confer Academic Degrees (Diplomas,
          Certificate Courses, etc.), Digitizing the ancient literatures,
          Establishing a Digital Library, Imparting training and orientation,
          Conducting short-term as well as residential long-term courses,
          Conducting Workshops, Seminars, Symposia, Conferences, Setting up of a
          Library with a well-furnished Reading Room with acquisition of Sai
          Literatures along with other classic publications, Using Social Media
          Platform like its own Website, Twitter/FB Page, etc.
