          Sri Sarthya Sai Seva Organisation, founded by Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai
          Baba in the year 1965, is a service organisation with a spiritual core
          and base to benefit all mankind irrespective of religion, caste, creed
          or sect. The Organisation serves as a platform for its members to
          undertake service and other activities as their sadhana (spiritual
          discipline) which is motivated by an urge for self-transformation to
          realise oneâ€™s inherent divinity.
